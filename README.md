Statistics for Natural Scientists Assessment 
Academic Year 2024/25, Semester 1 
Instructions: This   is the assessment for   EART11200   Natural Scientists’ Toolkit: Statistics   for   Natural Scientists. The assessment   includes the following files:
SFNS Assessment S1 2024.pdf: This document   presents the   questions   that you   will   need   to   answer   in this assessment.
SFNS Assessment S1 2024 answer sheet.docx: This   is the   document   on   which   you   will   answer the assessment questions. You will   need to   consult “SFNS Assessment   S1   2024.pdf” for a full explanation of the   questions   to   be   answered.
After you   have answered the   questions on   “SFNS Assessment S1   2024   answer   sheet.docx,”   please save the document as   a   PDF.   Name the   file   with your   student   number   followed   by “_stats_assessment.pdf” (for example,   123456789_stats_assessment.pdf) and submit the PDF via   Blackboard   by 9 January 2025 at 9:00 am. 
The   assessment   is   divided   into three sections, each with several   parts.   In   section   1, you   will   choose statistical tests to   use,   but you will   not   need to   conduct   the   analyses.   In   section   2, you will   interpret analyses where   R output   has   been   provided for   you.   In   question   2.2.3 you   will also   provide a figure to   illustrate your conclusion.   All   the   information   you   need   to answer the   questions   in section   2 can   be found   in the   R output   or   in   the   questions themselves.   In section 3, you will analyse   datasets   that   have   been   provided for   you,   either   in   the text of the question   (as   in question   3.1)   or   in   separate   CSV files   (questions   3.2   to   3.4).
You should attempt to answer   all   parts of   all   questions.   The   marks   for   each   question   are clearly   indicated. You   may   use the   unit   handbook, your   notes or completed   practicals, starter code for   practicals,   code you   have written during   the   semester,   and the   answer   keys   to completed   practicals while completing this assessment.   You   may   also   use   online resources   or   external   handbooks/textbooks   (but   I   hope you will   not   need to!).   However, you must not collaborate with others while completing   this   assessment.   Collaboration   on   this assessment   is   detectable,   so   please   do   not   do   it!   If you   have   questions   about the assessment, you can   post them to the discussion   board so   I   can   answer   publicly.   This ensures that everyone   has the same   information about the   assessment.   You   can   find   the   discussion   board   here:
https://online.manchester.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_81724_1/cl/outline 
If you   have   not done so already,   I   recommend that you   subscribe   to   the   discussion   board   so   you get a   message anytime   I   post   a   new   answer.
If you   have a   DASS   plan that specifies   an extension   on   coursework   assessments, then   you can apply that extension to this assessment.   In   practice,   I   recommend   that   you   do   not   use your extension even   if you are entitled to   one.   The   assessment   is   designed   so   that   everyone   can complete   it   before the deadline.   If you apply   an   extension to   the   standard   deadline, then this   assessment will drag   into the exam   period,   and   it   may   not   be   in   your   interest   to allow that to   happen.   Please   note that the discussion   board will close   at   the   standard submission deadline. This   is   important   because   it ensures that   no   new   information about the assessment   becomes   available after some students   have   been   required   to   submit.   So,   if   you   have a   DASS extension and   intend to   use   it,   please   make   sure that   you   have   asked   any questions you   need to ask   before the standard submission   deadline.
Section 1 (4 marks each) 
For each question in section 1, answer i) what is the predictor and is it numerical or categorical (if there is more than one predictor, answer this for all the predictors); ii) what is the response and is it numerical or categorical, and iii) what test would you use to 
answer the question? 
1.1 Benthic   macrophytes   are   plants that grow on the   bottoms of water   bodies   like   lakes,   ponds, and streams. Your   research team   has observed   one   sampling   site   in   each   of 100 different   rivers   in the   UK. (So,   in all, you   observed   100   sites.)   Each   sampling   site         had a   mean annual depth of   20   cm.   Your   team   measured the   mean   annual   turbidity   in   NTUs and the   mean annual flow   rate   in   ms-1    at each site,   and   recorded   whether   there were   macrophytes growing   at each site. You   did   not   count the   macrophytes, you just   recorded whether they were   present or absent. You   want   to   understand how the   probability that   macrophytes grow at a   particular   site   depends   on the   mean   annual turbidity and   mean annual flow   rate at   that   site.   What   test   would   you   use   to      answer this   question? 
1.2 You are conducting   a study to   assess   whether   it   is   possible   to   learn   statistics   by osmosis. You enrol   100 students as   participants. You   assign   50   students   randomly   to   a treatment group, and you assign the   other   50 to   a   control   group. You   supply   each participant with a   handbook on statistical   methods. You   instruct   each   student to study as they ordinarily would.   However, you   instruct   students   in the   treatment group to   place their   handbook   under their   pillow when they goto   bedon the   night   before their   exam. You   instruct students   in the control group to   leave   their handbook on their desk when they goto   bed.   You   obtain   the   marks   for   the participants   from   the   unit   coordinator. The   marks   are   anonymisedin   such   away   that you cannot   match them to   particular students,   but you   can   match them   to   either   the   treatment or control group. Your goal   is to   test   the   hypothesis   that   students   in   the treatment group earned   higher   marks. What test would you   use to   answer   this   question? 
1.3 Following   on your study   about   learning   by osmosis, you are   also   interested   in whether student’s   breakfast choices   affect their exam   performance. You   recruit   120      students who are enrolled   in the second   year   Animal   Behaviour   unit   to   participate   in   a study. You   randomly assign each student   to   eat   one   of   three   breakfasts   on   the   day of the exam: oatmeal, cornflakes, or   nori   and   rice.   You   conjecture   that   familiarity with the   breakfast   may also   be   important, so you ask   each   student whether   the breakfast they   have   been assigned   is something they commonly   eat. Their   options   when answering this   question   are simply “yes”   or   “no.” There   are   at   least   10 students   in   both the “yes” and   “no” groups for each   breakfast type.   After   the   exam,   you obtain the anonymised   marks for each   of the   six   groups   (ie,   oatmeal-yes, oatmeal-no, cornflakes-yes, etc) from the   unit coordinator. You   want to   know whether   breakfast choice affects exam   performance, whether   having   a familiar breakfast affects exam   performance, and whether the   effect   of   familiarity   is different for the different   breakfast types. What test would you   use to   answer   this   question?
1.4 You work for a company that   sells   three   flavours   of   breakfast   cereal:   Coco   Sugar Bombs, Atomic Strawberry   Loops, and   Marshmallow   Puffies.   Using   data collected when customers scan their   loyalty cards   at grocery   store   checkouts,   your   company   has   assembled a   list of customers who   bought   exactly   one   of these   cereals   and bought exactly one of the following   brands   of   candy   on   the   same   day:   Rouse’s Peanut   Butter   Balls,   Life   Preservers   Hard Candy, or Twisters   Cranberry   Liquorice. Your company wants to design a   targeted   marketing   campaign,   and to   do   this   they   want to   know whether the candy that   people   buy   predicts which   cereal   they   will choose. What test would you   use to answer this   question?
1.5 It   is widely   believed that the   biodiversity of ecosystems   is   higher   closer to   the equator,   but this   has   rarely   been studied for aquatic   microorganisms. Your ship-based   research team   has sampled seawater from the surface   of the   Atlantic   Ocean   along   a   north-south transect   starting   at   (60.00。, -45.60。)   (approximately   20   km southwest   of   Nanortalik,   Greenland)   and   ending   at   (1.50。, -45.60。)   (approximately      20   km   northeast of   Belém,   Brazil). You collected one   sample   every   10   km   along   the   transect, for a total of 650   samples. You   used   shotgun   sequencing   to   estimate   the microbial community composition of each   sample,   and   you   computed the   Shannon diversity   index for each community. The Shannon diversities   in   your   samples   ranged   from 2.1 to 5.9. You want to   know   if   the   Shannon   diversity   of   aquatic   microbiota increases   as you approach the equator. What test   would   you   use   to   answer   this   question?
Section 2 
Each question in this section is followed by a block of R code and output. The output provided is sufficient to answer the questions. You may not need to use all the output. 
Question 2.1 (16 marks) 
You are studying winter wheat yields   in   experimental   plots   using   three   different   brands   of   fertiliser:   brands A,   B, and C. You want to   understand the   performance   of   each   fertiliser   in each of two conditions.   In the “constant”   condition, winter wheat   was   grown   in   the experimental   plot for five consecutive years   before your study.   In the “fallowed”   condition,   winter wheat was grown   in the experimental   plot for   four   consecutive   years,   but   a   cover crop of   red clover was grown   in the   plot   in the   year   before   your   study.   You   plant   winter wheat   in a total of   72 experimental   plots,   36 of   which   were   constant   and   36   of   which   were fallowed.   Each   plot   has   an area of   1   hectare. You assign   12   constant   and   12 fallowed   plots   to   be treated with each fertiliser   brand according to the   manufacturers’   instructions.   Six   plots are   destroyed   by flooding   in the spring, so you end   up   with   66   plots   in total.   At   the   end   of the growing   season, you   record the   harvest from each   plot   in   metric tons. Thus, your   data includes the fertiliser, the condition, and the   yield   for   each   plot.   Your   colleague   has   conducted the analyses shown   below.   Use these   analyses to answer   the   following questions: 
2.1.1          Controlling for the plot condition, is there evidence that the fertiliser brand affects the crop yield? If so, which brand(s) provide higher yields than which others? Report your results clearly and concisely. 
2.1.2          Controlling for the fertiliser brand, is their evidence that the plot condition affects the crop yield? If so, in what way? Report your result clearly and concisely. 
2.1.3             Is there evidence that the performance of the fertiliser brands depends on the condition of the field being fertilised? Report your result clearly and concisely. 
2.1.4          Fertiliser brand A is running an advertising campaign to take market share from brand C. The company that produces brand A claims that constantly cropped fields fertilised with their brand yield as much winter wheat as recently fallowed fields fertilised with brand C. Does your study provide evidence to support or refute this claim? If so, what is that evidence?model.y1=aov(yeild~condition+fertiliser+condition*fertiliser,data)summary(y1)Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)condition 1 59.39 59.39 65.267 3.6e-11 ***fertiliser 2 9.86 4.93 5.417 0.00688 **condition:fertiliser 2 1.62 0.81 0.888 0.41680Residuals 60 54.60 0.91Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1TukeyHSD(y1)Tukey multiple comparisons of means95% family-wise confidence levelFit: aov(formula = yeild ~ condition * fertiliser, data = data)$conditiondiff lwr upr p adjfallowed-constant 1.897237 1.427483 2.366991 0$fertiliserdiff lwr upr p adjB-A -0.9112102 -1.6031428 -0.219277638 0.0067901C-A -0.7009556 -1.4003533 -0.001557787 0.0493741C-B 0.2102547 -0.4734082 0.893917534 0.7413272$`condition:fertiliser`diff lwr upr p adjfallowed:A-constant:A 1.50219676 0.275210739 2.72918278 0.0080068constant:B-constant:A -1.11891362 -2.291117787 0.05329055 0.0695691fallowed:B-constant:A 0.81928222 -0.378133528 2.01669796 0.3466859constant:C-constant:A -1.09702419 -2.324010207 0.12996183 0.1053138fallowed:C-constant:A 1.18146225 0.009258084 2.35366642 0.0471388constant:B-fallowed:A -2.62111038 -3.823505003 -1.41871575 0.0000004fallowed:B-fallowed:A -0.68291454 -1.909900560 0.54407148 0.5769400constant:C-fallowed:A -2.59922095 -3.855081176 -1.34336072 0.0000013fallowed:C-fallowed:A -0.32073451 -1.523129132 0.88166012 0.9690044fallowed:B-constant:B 1.93819583 0.765991665 3.11040000 0.0001211constant:C-constant:B 0.02188943 -1.180505198 1.22428406 0.9999999fallowed:C-constant:B 2.30037587 1.153937576 3.44681416 0.0000026constant:C-fallowed:B -1.91630641 -3.143292425 -0.68932039 0.0003138fallowed:C-fallowed:B 0.36218004 -0.810024134 1.53438421 0.9425841fallowed:C-constant:C 2.27848644 1.076091814 3.48088107 0.0000089model.y2=aov(yeild~condition+fertiliser,data)summary(model.y2)Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)condition 1 59.39 59.39 65.503 2.73e-11 ***fertiliser 2 9.86 4.93 5.436 0.00668 **Residuals 62 56.22 0.91---Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1TukeyHSD(model.y2)Tukey multiple comparisons of means95% family-wise confidence levelFit: aov(formula = yeild ~ condition + fertiliser, data = data)$conditiondiff lwr upr p adjfallowed-constant 1.897237 1.428643 2.365832 0$fertiliserdiff lwr upr p adjB-A -0.9112102 -1.6013293 -0.221091149 0.0065961C-A -0.7009556 -1.3985202 -0.003390864 0.0486406C-B 0.2102547 -0.4716164 0.892125697 0.7404923model.y3=aov(yeild~fertiliser+condition,data)summary(model.y3)Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)fertiliser 2 9.17 4.58 5.056 0.00924 **condition 1 60.08 60.08 66.263 2.26e-11 ***Residuals 62 56.22 0.91---Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1TukeyHSD(model.y3)Tukey multiple comparisons of means95% family-wise confidence levelFit: aov(formula = yeild ~ fertiliser + condition, data = data)$fertiliserdiff lwr upr p adjB-A -0.9072822 -1.5974012 -0.2171631 0.0068613C-A -0.5695452 -1.2671099 0.1280195 0.1306677C-B 0.3377370 -0.3441341 1.0196080 0.4639370$conditiondiff lwr upr p adjfallowed-constant 1.904262 1.435667 2.372856 0model.y4=aov(yeild~fertiliser,data)summary(model.y4)Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)fertiliser 2 9.17 4.585 2.484 0.0916 .Residuals 63 116.30 1.846---Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1TukeyHSD(model.y4)Tukey multiple comparisons of means95% family-wise confidence levelFit: aov(formula = yeild ~ fertiliser, data = data)$fertiliserdiff lwr upr p adjB-A -0.9072822代 写EART11200 Statistics for Natural Scientists AssessmentR

Question 2.2 (12 marks) 
You are studying blood lead levels in children in a small US city. The city has two elementary schools: Dana School in the relatively affluent part of the city and Park Street School in the less affluent part of the city. There is no bussing programme in the city, so children go to school in the areas where they live. The city has done a voluntary screening for blood lead levels among students at each school and you have obtained the anonymised data (Dana, 36 students; Park Street; 35 students). For each child, you have two pieces of information: the school they attend (either Dana or Park Street) and their blood lead level (in µg/dL). Your colleague has performed the analyses below. Use these analyses to do the following:
2.2.1          Test the hypothesis that children at Park Street School have higher blood lead 
levels than children at Dana School. Report your results clearly and concisely.

Section 3 
In this section, data is provided in each question or datasets are provided separately. Analyse the datasets to answer each question. 
Question 3.1 (4 marks) 
It   is   commonly   believed that the   police are   more   likely to   issue tickets to   drivers   in   red   cars   than to drivers   in cars of other   colours.   Often,   this   is   attributed   tobias   on   the   part   of   the police. You want to test an alternative   explanation:   perhaps   drivers   in   cars   of   some   colours are   more   likely to commit traffic violations. To test this   idea, you   obtain   a   Doppler   radar   unit   and setup a   monitoring   experiment   in   a school zone   on   a   small two-lane   road   in   South Manchester. You   monitor traffic on the   road for 4   hours.   For   each car   that   passes,   you record the colour   (red, white,   black, or   blue –   other   colours   are   rare   or   ambiguous   so you   do   not   record them)   and whether the car was   exceeding the   20   mph   speed   limit   (yes   or   no).
You also   record the   registration   number   on   each car’s   number   plate.   If you observe the same car   more than once, you only   count the   first   observation.   This   ensures   that   your   study      does   not suffer from   pseudoreplication. Counting only the   first   observation   for   each   car,   you   observe a total   285 cars. Of these,   48   were   red,   143   were   white,   60   were   black,   and   34   were      blue.   In all, 91 cars were   exceeding the   speed   limit.   Of   these,   24   were   red,   37   were   white,   20   were   black, and   10 were   blue. 
3.1.1          Does your study provide evidence that car colour is non-randomly associated 
with speeding at the study site? Report your result clearly and concisely. 
3.1.2          You show your results to a friend and they notice that the speeding rate is 
lowest among white cars. They sum up the red, blue, and black cars that were obeying the speed limit (88 cars) and those that were exceeding the speed limit (54 cars). They conduct a test comparing the numbers of white cars that were obeying or exceeding the speed limit to the numbers of all other cars combined that were obeying or exceeding the speed limit, and they obtain ap-value of 0.0381. They argue that this is evidence that the drivers of white cars are less likely than the drivers of other cars to exceed the limit. Is their conclusion valid? Why or why not? 
Question 3.2 (20 marks) 
There are   nearly   300   moons orbiting   planets or   dwarf   planets   in the   Solar   System. The   file   “moon_size.csv” contains   the   following   data   on   those   moons:
name: the   name of   the   moon
parent: the   name of the   planet or   dwarf   planet around   which   the   moon   orbits log.radius: the   log   of the   mean   radius   (in   km)   of the   moon
log.parent.radius: the   log   of the   radius   (in   km)   of the   planet or   dwarf   planet around   which the   moon orbits
You want to   know whether the   moons around   larger   planets tend to   be   larger   than   the moons   around smaller   planets. You   recognise that the   planets and dwarf   planets   in   the Solar System differ   in   many ways other than   their   radii   (eg,   density,   distance   from   the   sun),   and that some of these differences   may   affect the   sizes   of   the   moons   they   collect. 
3.2.1          Conduct an analysis to answer your question of interest. Report your 
results clearly and concisely. (Note: logged radii are unitless.) 
3.2.2          Provide a figure to illustrate your result. 
3.2.3          Is there evidence from your data that moon sizes differ among planets for reasons other than the size of the planet? If so, what proportion of the variability in moon size that is not explained by the size of the planet is explained by some other (unknown) attributes of the planet? 
Question 3.3 (8 marks) 
Leucopsar fictitious is a starling species   native to   Indonesia.   It   is   critically   endangered   in the   wild,   but   is   maintained   in   captivity   by   aviculturalists.
Like   many   birds, juvenile L. fictitious learn their   behaviours from their   parents. The set of behaviours   birds   need   in captivity   is   different from the set they   need to survive   in   the   wild.
If adult   birds stop   using some   behaviours when they   are   brought   into   captivity,   then juveniles   may   not   learn those   behaviours.   If these   behaviours are   not available to   birds that   are   released from captivity   into the wild, then this   may   limit the   success   of   reintroductions from captive   populations as a conservation   tool.   If   behaviours   are   passed   from   parents   to offspring, then each generation   in captivity   provides a   new   risk for   the   loss   of   behaviours, and   birds that   have   been   maintained   in captivity for   more generations   may   be   less valuable   to conservation.   (See Tanimoto et al   (2017) for   a   similar   concern   in the   Hawai’ian   crow, Corvus hawaiiensis.)
The   pedigrees of captive L. fictitious individuals   have   been carefully tracked since   the   birds   were   brought   into captivity, so for any   individual we   can   count the   number   of   generations since   its   most   recent wild ancestor. Your team   is doing   a   study to   understand   whether   the number   of generations that   birds   have   been   in captivity affects their   success   when they   are reintroduced to the wild. You   have obtained 70   breeding   pairs   of L. fictitious and   released them   into the wild at different sites   in their   native   range.   Pairs   are   matched   for   generations   in captivity – that   is,   in each   pair, the   male and   female   were   maintained   in   captivity   for   the same   number   of generations. You   monitor   each   pair   after   release, and   record whether   both   birds   in the   pair   are still alive one year   after the   release   date.   (If   one   bird   in   a   pair   dies   then      the other   usually   disperses, and you cannot track   birds that   have   dispersed.   So,   in   general, you do   not   know   if   both   birds   have   died, you only   know whether   at   least one   has   died.)   If both   birds   are still alive, you   record whether the   pair   has   successfully   reproduced   (ie, whether they are   raising at   least one juvenile). Juvenile L. fictitious remain   in   their   parents’   nest for a year, so   if the   parents   reproduced successfully   since   release, you   will   certainly observe the juvenile on the   monitoring   date.
Your   data   is stored   in the file “L_fictitious.csv.” The   columns   in   the dataset   are:
ID:   a   unique   identifier for   each   breeding   pair
generations: the   number   of generations that the   birds   in the   pair   were   in captivity survived:   an   indicator with value   1   if   both   members   of the   pair were alive   and 0   if either   member   of the   pair   had died one year   after the   release   date
bred:   an   indicator with value   1   if the   pair was   raising at   least one juvenile   one year after the   release   date and 0   if they   were   not   Use this data to answer   the following   questions: 
3.3.1          Does the probability that a breeding pair survived after release into the wild 
depend on the number of generations they were in captivity? If so, how? Report your results clearly and concisely. 
3.3.2          A conservation organisation you work with has obtained a pair of birds that have been in captivity for 5 generations. They plan to release these birds into the wild, and they have asked you to predict the probability that the birds will survive for at least one year after reintroduction. What is your prediction? 
3.3.3          If a breeding pair survived for at least one year, does the probability that the 
pair bred successfully in the wild depend on the number of generations for which the birds had been in captivity? If so, how? Report your result clearly and concisely. 
Question 3.4 (20 marks) 
Several widely   used flame   retardants   are   known to   persist   in the environment and   to bioaccumulate   in animals.   One class of flame   retardants,   polybrominated   diphenyl   ethers   (PBDEs),   has   been shown to   reduce eggshell thickness   in at   least   some   bird   species (Guigeuno and   Fernie   2017)   . Similar   reductions   in eggshell thickness caused   by   the bioaccumulation of   DDT   led to the   near-extinction of some   raptor   species   before   DDT was banned   by   most countries   in the   1970s.   For this   reason,   understanding the effects   of   PBDEs   on eggshell thickness   may   be   important for   conservation. 
Your   research team   is studying the effect of   bioaccumulated   PBDEs   on   eggshell   thickness   in two   populations of   house sparrows   (Passer domesticus). You   have sampled   50   nests   in   each   of two   house sparrow   populations:   an   urban   population   in   Brooklyn,   NY,   USA   and a   rural population   in Castleton, VT,   USA. You   have taken a   blood sample   from   the   female   in   each   nest and assessed the   PBDE concentration   in the female’s   blood.   You   have   randomly selected one egg from each   nest   and   measured the thickness   of   the   shell   using   terahertz reflectance spectroscopy   (Khaliduzzaman et al.   2020)   . The file   “eggshells.csv”   contains the   data your team collected. The columns   in the   data   set   are: 
ID:   a   unique   identifier for   each   nest
population: the   population of each   nest   (either   “NY” or   “VT”)
PBDE: the concentration of   PBDE   in the   blood of the   female   in   each   nest   (in   ng/g) thickness: the thickness of each   shell   (in   μm)
There   is at   least some   reason to   believe that eggshell thickness   in   the   Brooklyn   and Castleton   populations   may   differ   independent of any effects of   PDBEs. The   urban   (Brooklyn)   site   is   likely to   have   higher   concentrations of   industrial chemicals and the   rural   (Castleton) site   is   likely to   have   higher   concentrations of agricultural chemicals,   and   either   or   both   of these   may affect eggshell thickness. Therefore, your team wants to   study the   relationship   between   PBDEs and eggshell thickness while controlling   for   population. 
Use the data   in   “eggshell.csv” to answer the following   questions:3.4.1          Controlling for population, is there a relationship between the concentration of 
PBDEs in a female house sparrow’s blood and the thickness of the shells of the eggs she lays? If so, what that relationship? Report your results clearly and concisely. 
3.4.2          Is there a difference in eggshell thickness in the two study populations that 
cannot be attributed to the concentration of PBDEs in the mothers’ blood? Report your results clearly and concisely. 
3.4.3          Does the effect of PDBE concentration in the mothers’ blood affect eggshell 
thickness differently in the two populations? Report your results clearly and concisely. 
3.4.4          Provide a figure to illustrate your results. 
3.4.5          You sample a female house sparrow and find she has a PBDE concentration of 
4.6 ng/g in her blood. How thick would you expect her eggshells to be if she comes from the Brooklyn population? How thick would you expect her eggshells to be if she comes from the Castleton population? 
Notes 
All of the   data we   used   in   practicals this semester   was   real,   but   most   of the   data   in   this   assessment   is   made   up. The   exception   is the   moon   data   in question 3.2, which   is   real.
